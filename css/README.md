# CSS Fixes

This folder contains CSS used to fix some of the annoying problems from the default CSS in the CampusGroups instance.

The CSS files here are named after the instance name. For example, [msbgeorgetown.css](msbgeorgetown.css) is meant for [msbgeorgetown.campusgroups.com](https://msbgeorgetown.campusgroups.com).

Please retain the version header so that it is easier to track future updates.
